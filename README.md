# Amateur Photography Site JavaScript

### Description
This is the final project of my JavaScript class in my fourth semester at Gateway. The project is an amateur photography blog site I built from scratch which showcases some of the best pictures I took. It still needs a lot prettying up to do, but it's at least mostly functional.
- The **home page** splits my pictures into sections. At the top of the page, it will ask for your name. It saves your name in localstorage, and will remember your name even if you navigate from the site and come back. For this to work, the site must be running on a server, such as localhost. If you click on any of the three images on the home page, you will be redirected to more images consistent with the theme of the image. If you click on any of these images, it will display a caption describing the picture.

- The **contact page** displays some form validation. Once the form is complete and submitted, a thank you message will appear with a button to take you back to the home page.
- The **time page** displays a time calculator which calculates the time since a past date which you can specify.
- The **OBJ page** displays 'OOP' related content. It shows more images, which if you click on, will display a caption describing the image. At the bottom, you can rate your favorite images and it will return the results showing your top three favorites images from first to third.
- Lastly, the **API page** displays an API from Flicker using JSONP. It used to be a dog photo, but the photo changes from time to time.

### How to Run the Program
The easiest way to run the program is with Visual Studio Code. Open the index.html file, right click inside the page, and select 'open with live server' to run the page and it should work as intended.

Here is a link to my project. It is located on my portfolio site.
